You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/IIMrFreemanII/untitled`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.
